#Functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity, conservation and trait evolution models

This repository contains R codes that can be used to evaluate, under many different models of trait evolution,
whether selecting m species to maximize PD lead to more functional diversity 
than a random set of species of the same size. 


In this repository, we provide three files:

- **CreateImbalancedTrees.R**, which enable the user to create imbalanced trees of a given size  
- **FunctionsToLoad.R**, which contains functions needed to run the PD/FD analysis   
- **RunAnalysis.R**, which run the entire analysis given a set of parameters   
  - size and type of the phylogenetic tree,
  - number of traits,
  - model of trait evolution and its parameters
  - number of species selected in the subset,
